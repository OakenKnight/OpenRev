1. First step is to acquire docker images for all Hyperledger Fabric samples using this command:


	curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s


2. After all docker images are pulled, inside folder "test-network" there is a script that starts the system:


	 startSystem.sh


3. Inside folder "openrev-gateway-api" there is two types of docker compose files:
	- docker-compose.yaml used for local development that builds docker image and runs it.
	- docker-compose.staging.yml that uses docker image pushed to dockerhub.com. The same image will be used for proxy server runned inside k8 cluster.
